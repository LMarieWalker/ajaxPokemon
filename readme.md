## Pokemon Ajax

Using xmlhttprequest make requests to the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#pokemon) for 3 pokemon (you can request whatever ones you like). You will need to grab the pokemon(s) name, types, and a image of the pokemon to display.
Then using dom manipulation recreate the image below:

### Stretch goals:

 - Display types in a unordered list.
 - Below the image list the pokemon(s) abilities.
 - Add functionality so when a user hovers over a pokemon image it shows the shiny sprite.
 - Add a input field for the user to be able to request for additional pokemon.
